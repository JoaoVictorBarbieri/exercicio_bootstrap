            <h2 id="aboutThegame">Sobre o Jogo</h2>
            <p>Grand Chase (Korean: 그랜드체이스, lit. Grand Chase) is a free-to-play, two-dimensional side-scrolling MMORPG developed by the South Korean company KOG Studios. Alternative names for Grand Chase include 3小俠 (Three Young Heroes) used on the Taiwan server but was changed to 永恆冒險 (Eternal Adventures). Another name used was 彩虹骑士 (Rainbow Warriors) on the Mainland Chinese server. The reopening of the server also used the name of the Taiwan and Hong Kong server.</p>
            <p>As of April 15, the game ceased development and terminated its service worldwide, with North America being the last foreign server to close in 2015.[1] The mobile sequel Grand Chase Dimensional Chaser was launched in January 2018.</p>
            <p>6 years after the closure, the game's return, now known as GrandChase Classic, has been announced in 2021 on Steam.[2] Recruitment for Global CBT Testers was held from June 30 to July 8[3] and officially relaunched on July 28.</p>
            <p>Grand Chase was awarded as Indonesia's most popular online game in August 2011 and has spawned several spin-off games such as Grand Chase Lite and Grand Chase M. It was also considered the "national online game" of Brazil.</p>
            <p>ELSWORD, another game developed by KOG, was regarded as the spiritual successor to Grand Chase, having subtle references within the story, such as using Elesis as a new character in the game.</p>

            <p>The Story Timeline expands the chronological table of Grand Chase history that was provided by KOG Studios[1] and summarizes all known events within the Grand Chase universe. It includes the jobs' backgrounds, passages from missions, and stories that were omitted after the story revamp but do not contradict the established lore, attempting to organize all of them in chronological order. For any inconsistencies found, whether a retcon or mistake on KOG's part, newer information is preferred.</p>

            <p>While some stories happened in an unspecified time, those that were indicated or hinted to happen between certain events will be placed accordingly. However, events in the manhwa cannot be inserted due to having a different narrative from the game.</p>
            
            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This article is currently under development. The events in Grand Chase Dimensional Chaser will not be included, however, the chronology of events is subject to change depending on the progression of the story in the sequel game.</p>

After the circus catches fire for some mysterious reason, Lass took his chance for freedom and began wandering Aernas. Lass's mind and body were freed from Kaze'aze's possession after the Grand Chase vanquished Kaze'aze's evil from the world. Lass still felt guilty when he realized that his body was used by Kaze'aze's.
